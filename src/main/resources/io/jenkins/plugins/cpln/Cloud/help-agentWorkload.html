    The name of the agent workload. A short, descriptive name is recommended. The provisioned agent workload name at the
    Control Plane GVC location will be formatted as [workload]-[label]-[random-suffix] where [workload] is the name of the
    workload in the cloud configuration, the [label] is the matching label (or empty if the unlabeled job matches) and
    [random-suffix] is a random alphanumeric string representing the unique workload. Such examples of provisioned workload
    names are west-blue-59984c4d, east-red, west-3bf79406, my-west-workload etc. Note that the maximum length of the combined
    workload name should be fewer than 50 characters.

    When enabling unique agents, one or many workloads with different random suffixes will be created to process incoming
    job items, based on specific load factors. It is recommended that you consult the Jenkins parameters MARGIN, MARGIN0
    and MARGIN_DECAY, which can help fine tune Jenkins resource provisioning scenarios. More details on <a href="https://docs.controlplane.com/concepts/workload">Workloads</a>
