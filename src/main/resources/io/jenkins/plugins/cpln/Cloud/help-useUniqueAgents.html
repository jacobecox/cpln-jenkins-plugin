    Check if you want the plugin to create unique / dedicated agent workloads for each (or a small number) of job items instead of
    handling a larger set of job items with a specific cloud configuration. If checked, the plugin allows Jenkins to provision one
    agent for each job item, so they can be processed concurrently regardless of how many concurrent jobs are allowed on
    each agent. The # of executors setting for the cloud configuration still works the same way but new agents are allowed to
    be provisioned based on load. If a unique agent is always meant to process a single job item at a time, set the # of executors
    on the corresponding cloud configuration to 1. Note that Jenkins provisioning continuously evaluates different load factors
    based on moving averages of available or not-yet-available executors, job queue length etc. Some over-provisioning of agents
    may be expected on job burst, very short job executions, substantial agent startup delays etc. Unused agents will be unprovisioned
    based on the configured idle timeout and so, removed from both Jenkins and Control Plane GVC locations. If available / allowed
    cloud capacity falls short, new agents that failed provisioning will be removed from Jenkins and queued jobs will be processed as
    new / additional cloud capacity becomes available.

    It is recommended that you consult the Jenkins parameters MARGIN, MARGIN0 and MARGIN_DECAY, which can help fine tune Jenkins
    resource provisioning scenarios.

        With a not too aggressive provisioning strategy, the below values may be considered:

        <code>... -Dhudson.slaves.NodeProvisioner.MARGIN=50 -Dhudson.slaves.NodeProvisioner.MARGIN0=0.85 -Dhudson.slaves.NodeProvisioner.MARGIN_DECAY=0.3 ...</code>
